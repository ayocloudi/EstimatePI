# EstimatePI
Monte Carlo simulation estimating π by generating random points within a unit square, and calculating the ratio of points within the inscribed quarter circle to the total points. Outputs estimated  π, showcasing the power of random sampling in approximating geometric constants with specified number of random points   N.
